# FREE & OPEN SOURCE HACKER (FOSH) 
*A path on self-learning COMPUTER SCIENCE through GAME and WEB DEVELOPMENT.*

Using as much as possible **OER** (open educational resources) and free courses around the web.  
I plan to develop it mainly in English, but also with materials in French.  

>(English is essential for this learning, take the time you need and go slowly trough all the material.)  

This path is supposed to be accomplished in many years of dedication, patience and courage. Start from where you are and not what you think you are supposed to be. Don't judge or compare yourself, you are an unique human being, learning computer science shouldn't make you a robot without feeling but should put you deeply in contact with your own experience of being human.

If you start this with an end result in mind, you will be harassed by the burden of your own expectations and you will give up, you need to enjoy every steps, to enjoy the process, to love the travel you going to make for your own learning. Sometimes you will look back and be amazed by all the results you produced as a side effect. If you don't love what you do, don't do it. Play is learning, not working.

See all this material proposed like bricks, you take what you need and build your own house, your personal path, here is the one I built for myself through years of learning, I used my savings, I took full free time and stop to work on anything else to dedicate myself to this path, you certainly don't have (or maybe you can't) to do this, find your own structure you will find yourself good in.

I try to have a time in the day for each of this phases.  
* Phase 0 : Mathematics - 5/10 hours per weeks
* Phase 1 : Computer Science Theory - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 2 : Programming Courses - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 3 : Coding personal projects - 15/20 hours per weeks
* Phase 4 : Writing Documentation and helping - 5/10 hours per weeks

>Quote : Hours per weeks proposed here are the ideal I built by lot of iterating and test about my own learning process, but you will find out what is the best for you.

###Phase 0

>Whatever is your level in math, start from where you are good and let flow the process on khan academy until the end, then we will talk about math for computer science.

|---|---|---|---|
|**Khan Academy**|[Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/math)|1 year||

###Phase 1

>I would propose to start with this course about learning to learn, have great insight about the learning process without the need to do an introduction to psychology :

|---|---|---|---|
| **Learning to learn** | [Link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) | The first month |[Apprendre Ã  apprendre](apprendre-apprendre)|

###Phase 2

>Python is the best language to start on the side of game/app development

|Title|Source|Time|Git|
|---|---|---|---|
|(French) **Apprendre Python**|[Link](http://python.developpez.com/cours/apprendre-python3/)| 3 month | [Apprendre python](apprendre-python)|

>HTML is the language (with CSS) we will learn for the site of web development, site web like codecademy and freebootcamp are a good introduction and we start directly to practice.

|Title|Source|Time|Git|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Codecademy**|[Link](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)|10 hours||
|**FreeBootCamp**|[Link](http://freecodecamp.com/map)|Only the begining track for Html/Css for now, 10 hours||

###Phase 3

>Here I will give you tips only, because it is about creativity and practicing, not following course.

###Phase 4

>Same than 3, it is about participating to the community by reading and sharing experiences.
