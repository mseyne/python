# FREE & OPEN SOURCE HACKER (FOSH) 
A path on self-learning COMPUTER SCIENCE and SOFTWARE ENGINEERING through GAME and WEB DEVELOPMENT.

Using as much as possible OER (open educational resources) and free courses around the web.  
I plan to develop it mainly in English, but also with materials in French.  

(English is essential for this learning, take the time you need and go slowly trough the material.)  
This path is supposed to be accomplished in many years of dedication, patience and courage.

If you start this with an end result in mind, you will give up, you need to enjoy every step, enjoy the process, love the travel you going to make for your own learning.
