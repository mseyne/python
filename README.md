# FREE & OPEN SOURCE HACKER (FOSH) 
*A path on self-learning COMPUTER SCIENCE through GAME and WEB DEVELOPMENT.*

Personal repository from the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

Using as much as possible **OER** (open educational resources) and free courses around the web.  
I plan to develop this path mainly in English, but also with materials in French.  

>(English is essential for this learning, take the time you need and go slowly trough all the materials.)  

This path is supposed to be accomplished in many years of dedication, patience and courage. Start from where you are and not from where you think you are supposed to be. Don't judge or compare yourself, you are an unique human being with an unique path, learning computer science shouldn't make you a robot with standardized skills or without having feeling about what you doing and create, in contrary you should be deeply in contact with your own experience as being human.

If you start this with a final result in mind, you will be harassed by the burden of your own expectations and you will give up, you need to enjoy every steps, to enjoy the process of learning, to love the travel you going to make for your own life. Sometimes you will look back and be amazed by all the results you produced as a side effect. If you don't love what you do, don't do it. Learning is play, not working.

See all this materials proposed like bricks, you take what you need and build your own house, your personal path, here is the one I built for myself through years of learning. I used my savings, I took full free time and stop to work on anything else to dedicate myself to this path, you certainly don't have (or maybe you can't) to do this, find your own structure you will find yourself good in. You can follow this order, and if you understand why you shouldn't, try to build an other order for yourself.

Let's go.

I try to have a time in the day for each of this phases.  
* Phase 0 : Mathematics - 5/10 hours per weeks
* Phase 1 : Computer Science Theory - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 2 : Programming Courses - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 3 : Coding personal projects - 15/20 hours per weeks
* Phase 4 : Writing documentation and helping - 5/10 hours per weeks

>Quote : Hours per weeks proposed here are the ideal I built by lot of iterating and test about my own learning process, but you will find out what is the best for you. I also really recommend the course Learning to learn to get started, because it can give you great insight about the way you deal when directing yourself to learn (to address fear of unknown, procrastination, belittle yourself, stress, all that make the learning more difficult).

###Phase 0, mathematics

>Whatever is your level in math, start from where you are good and let flow the process on khan academy until the end, then we will talk about math for computer science. If you really don't want to follow the math track, know than you don't need much math to be developer in many area, it just give you more tools to feel confidente and go deeper in the process and algorithms. Also, know than being good in math does not mean you can be a good programmer/developper, it is different area, both have their strenghts.

###Phase 1, computer science

>I would propose to start with this course about learning to learn, have great insight about the learning process without the need to do an introduction to psychology :

###Phase 2, web, app and game developpement

>In my opinion, Python is the best language to start programmation and making little tools/games/app, you don't have to do all of them like I did.

>HTML is the essential language (with CSS) than we will learn for web development before to jump to something else, site web like codecademy and freebootcamp are a good introduction and we can start directly to practice and play with it.

|**FreeBootCamp**|[Link](http://freecodecamp.com/map)|Only the begining track for Html/Css for now, 10 hours||

###Phase 3, practice open source project (personal and teams)

>Here I will give you tips only, because it is about creativity and practicing, not following course.

###Phase 4, write down your experience, write documentation and tutorials/courses, communicate with the community

>Same than 3, it is about participating to the community by reading and sharing experiences. I will put here great place to go, to find documentation and communities.
