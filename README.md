# FREE & OPEN SOURCE HACKER (FOSH) 
*A path on self-learning COMPUTER SCIENCE through GAME and WEB DEVELOPMENT.*

Personal repository from the [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

Using as much as possible **OER** (open educational resources) and free courses around the web.  
I plan to develop this personal path mainly in English, but also with materials in French.  

>(English is essential for this learning, take the time you need and go slowly trough all the materials.)  

This path is supposed to be accomplished in many months(years) of dedication, patience and courage. Start from where you are and not from where you think you are supposed to be. Don't judge or compare yourself, you are an unique human being with an unique path, learning computer science shouldn't make you a robot with standardized skills or without having feeling about what you doing and create, in contrary you should be deeply in contact with your own experience as being human.

If you start this with a final result in mind, you will be harassed by the burden of your own expectations and you will give up, you need to enjoy every steps, to enjoy the process of learning, to love the travel you going to make for your own life. Sometimes you will look back and be amazed by all the results you produced as a side effect. If you don't love what you do, don't do it. Learning is play, not working.

See all this materials proposed like bricks than you can put together to build your own house, your personal path, here is the one I build for myself as a life long learning path. I took full free time and stop to work on anything else to dedicate myself to this path, you certainly don't have (or maybe you can't) to do this, find your own structure you will find yourself good in. You can follow this in the same order, and if you understand why you shouldn't, try to build an other order for yourself and your own way of learning.

Let's go.

I try to have a time in the day for each of this phases.  
* Phase 0 : Mathematics - 5/10 hours per weeks
* Phase 1 : Computer Science Courses - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 2 : Practical Programming Courses - 10/15 hours per weeks
* Phase 3 : Coding personal projects - 15/20 hours per weeks
* Phase 4 : Writing documentation and articles to teach/learn the material - 5/10 hours per weeks

>Quote : Hours per weeks proposed here are the ideal I built by lot of iterating and test about my own learning process, but you will find out what is the best for you. I also really recommend the course Learning to learn to get started, because it can give you great insight about the way you deal when directing yourself to learn (to address fear of unknown, procrastination, belittle yourself, stress, all that make the learning more difficult) and also you have to understand your personal [style of learning](http://edudemic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/7-styles-of-learning.jpg).

>I would propose to start with this course about learning to learn, have great insight about the learning process without the need to do an introduction to psychology :

###Phase 0, mathematics

>Whatever is your level in math, start from where you are good and let flow the process on khan academy until the end, then we will talk about math for computer science. If you really don't want to follow the math track, know than you don't need much math to be developer in many area, it just give you more tools to feel confidente and go deeper in the process and algorithms. Also, know than being good in math does not mean you can be a good programmer/developper, it is different area, both have their strenghts.

###Phase 1, computer science

>We start with different introduction to computer science, the main langage learned is Python, but will go in many introduction to other langages.

###Phase 2, programming

>For me, Python is the best language to start programmation and making web app, mobile and game, I learn it to help me for phase 3.

>HTML is the essential language (with CSS) than we will learn for web development before to jump to something else, site web like codecademy and freebootcamp are a good introduction and we can start directly to practice and play with it.

###Phase 3, building personal projects

>Here I will give you tips only, because it is about creativity and practicing, not following course. You need to practice open source project (personal and teams) to continue the learning process as you get yourself in situation to solve your own problems. Little step by little step, build a porfolio which will be the way you can show your experience and make a paid job out of it.

###Phase 4, share and get feedback

>It is about participating to the community by reading and sharing experiences. I will put here great places where to go, to find documentation and communities of learners/teachers. It is all about to write down your experience in the same time your progress go along the path, write documentation and tutorials/courses, communicate with the community, help and be helped. You can start by setting up a blog
