#CS50 week 0

>what ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you, in Week 12, end up relative to yourself in Week0

- The science of computation, computational thinking, which is problem solving by taking some input which is a set of instructions which is a problem who run trough an algorithm and produce an output, the solution. 

- The art in computer science is to be able to move from an abstract level to an other, from low-level details to the high-level design of the program.

###BINARY

- Although decimal which ha 10 digits, 0 to 9 is more familiar to humans, the computer work only with 2 digits, 0 and 1.

- With two digits, you can represent almost every piece of information.

- For example, the number 125 in decimal, every number is in is own column : 100:1; 10:2; 1:5

- In binary, each column use a power of 2 instead of 10. 4:0, 2:0, 1:0

- To represent 1, we need to place 1 in the column 1. 4:0, 2:0, 1:1

- To represent 3, we need to place 1 in the columns 2 and 1. 4:0, 2:1, 1:1

- And so one, we continue incrementing as follow : for a 5 : 4:1, 2:0, 1:1 // for a 6 : 4:1, 2:1, 1:0

###ASCII

- Is a standard map of numbers for letters. A is 65, B is 66, etc.. as bit can only store numbers, programs translate them for humans to be easily read.


###ALGORITHMS

- Algorithms are sets of instructions to solve particular problems, takings inputs and producing outputs that are hopefully correct, but also efficient.


####Boolean Expression

False or True

####Fonctions

Patterns repeating in a program can be simplified.

####Variable
A variable is like a container (a glass bowl) implemented as bits on a hard drive or memory, that stores a particular value.

####Loop for

A loop is doing the same thing over and over again.

####If condition

A condition, or branch, will handle certain cases.
